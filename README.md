# Parallel Execution of Sql Code

An executable that runs SQL files placed in a folder according to the instructions provided by the user.  The instructions allow for arbitrary complex parallel execution.  Multiple examples are given.

If folks within my healthcare system are interested in using this, I may place it on a SharePoint site to allow folks to upload and schedule jobs.  Please email if you are interested at ronald.hauser@(healthcare suffix)
